## Project
fifth/ui is a ui library using the shadcn registry, they aren't specifically meant to replace shadcn/ui or other libraries. This library is only meant to be for that I personally think should be added, most normal components have such great options already, there is no reason I should make my own, or that mine would even be better.

## Suggestions
If you find some components you think should be added, please make an issue on the [GitHub](https://github.com/FifthWit/ui/issues/new) and send over where ever the component is.
